# Twisting the Facts
News media bias in covering international news

# Abstract
With the development of new technologies, people have access to tremendous amounts of sources to keep up with the events of the world. This increase of sources made it nearly impossible for people to get a sense of how biased the media are in transferring the facts and events. With an increasing number of sources, there is increasing risks of misinformation. 
The goal of our project is to raise awareness of the potential bias of news sources in each country and develop a visual representation to demonstrate it. To that aim, we used the dataset provided by the GDELT project which contains the key information needed to investigate international news coverage. 
The idea is to offer textual analysis and graphical content to present the results. We will include node graphs linking sources to one another and maps that will indicate the different characteristics of media coverage in different countries. 

# Research questions
- How differently is one event translated in local news depending on the country or the media? 

- Which category of news tends to be less covered depending on the country or the media?

- How do media can introduce bias while keeping their credibility as a source of information?

- How can we use the graph visualization to demonstrate the bias in the news sources?

- What conclusions can we draw about one country by studying its media coverage?



# Dataset
The targeted dataset for this project is GDELT 2.0. Its exhaustive description of events around the globe provides tools to investigate the news coverage in different country. 
All articles and citations comes with multiple indexes (confidence, tone, Goldstein scale) that provides great insights to get an idea of the polarity of the media or even the country.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Data cleaning: deal with empty cells, drop irrelevant columns, find interesting metrics.
- Find events with worldwide coverage to check the project hypothesis.
- Extract new features by applying various analysis methods on the data.

# Questions for TAa
On which period of time was the data extracted? Was it only a day, a month or a year?
